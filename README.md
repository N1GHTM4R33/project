## ‚úçÔ∏è Introduction

DiceBear is an avatar library for designers and developers. You can choose between simple identicons or lovely designed characters. The goal is to avoid wasting time designing your own avatar while dicebear's community have a huge choice of premade avatars. You can also pull request if you want a specific avatar. 
You can upload them in several format like: 
1. PNG
2. JPG
3. SPG
4. With the free HTTP-API (the easiest way)
5. Use the JavaScript library

This is a few example of different avatars you can find on Dicebear:

| Avatar| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Female| Pixel art reprensenting plenty of women | 
| Male| Pixel art representing plenty of men|
| Croodles neutral| Drawings of faces |

I will analyse this repository from GitHub: [DICEBEAR](https://github.com/dicebear/dicebear)

## üñãÔ∏èDicebear's Git

There are five contributors registered on the repository. Nevertheless only one is active and spend a lot of time to develop the repository.

Regarding the community, there are 128 forks which means that a lot of people have download the repository to work on it. There are also 3.8k stars which emphasize the quality of this repository. Futhermore we can notice that 15 people have activated the watching which means that they received a notification when there is something changing on the repository(a new version, a new comment, a new push...).
Even if the community is quite big, the discussion space is not very used. People doesn't interact on this repository. Some of them focus on new ideas but there are only contributor's answers. 

There are some issues due to the collaborating work but the major part of them have been fixed which emphasize the activity of the contributors. Moreover there are 17 pull requests closed and only one which is open. Nonetheless the discussion space regarding all the issues and requests is empty which put forward the lack of community implication to develop the git page.

In addition the git page is still alive thanks to the amount of version released by the contibutors, once a month until october 2021.

Regarding the language used, 98% is TypeScript and only 1% is JavaScript or Svelte. This is logical if we remembered that there is only one contributor who is active and regulate the git page.
